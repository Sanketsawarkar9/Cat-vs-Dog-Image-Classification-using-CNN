# Cat-vs-Dog-Image-Classification-using-CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on manually loaded and preprocessed image data, with layers including Conv2D, MaxPooling, BatchNormalization, Dropout, and Dense layers to improve performance and avoid overfitting. The project includes data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction steps.
